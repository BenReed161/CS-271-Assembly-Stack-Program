# CS-271-Assembly-Stack-Program
An Assembly program that only relies on pushing and popping values from the stack rather than storing them in predefined variables. 
The assigment has no main implemented, due to the nature of the assignment there was no need for the main because everything would be dealt
on the stack. The program functionality would be tested on by the Grading Assistant.
The main functionality of the program is key encryption and key decryption using a "shift-cypher" type encoding, subtracting and adding back by a certain amount to
obtain the desired key, in this case it's 97 or the ascii value of a. This program is using the Intel x86 Assembly Architecture using the "Irvine32" ASM library.
